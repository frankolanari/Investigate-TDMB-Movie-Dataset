# My-Projects.
This project was done as one of the projects in Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree.
The assignment is to investigate a movie dataset, brainstorm insightfull questions and draw some conclusions.
In order to properly execute the task, I had to go through several processes which includes; gathering the data, data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
After gathering the data, I assessed and cleaned the data (data wrangling).
The analyses in prensented in a way easy to follow along, do enjoy ;)
